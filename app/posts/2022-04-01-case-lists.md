title: "Improving case lists for Probation Practioners and Service Providers"
description: "Create new design proposals to improve performance of case lists for our users that have a lot of cases loading."
date: 2020-04-01

The amazing Leigh Christie kicked off this design work to help improve the user experience for Probation practioners and Service Providers who would sometimes have performance issues when opening the "All cases" tab on their case list view.

## Findings

- Received positive comments that GOV.UK style is better than the current system.
- Didn't get to the core user needs.
- Next steps - Run co-design workshops with Probation Practitioners on "How might we make the start of the probation journey better?".
